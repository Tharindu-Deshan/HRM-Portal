# HRM-Portal

HRM-Portal is a web application that allows users to manage various aspects of human resources, such as employee profiles, leave management and more. It is a Human Resource Management System, build using React and Node.js along with several other tools.
We use MySQL as the database for this project. Material UI is used for the UI components.
This project was created as a part of the course CS3043 - Database Systems at University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. We had our evoluations and the final presentation on 2023-11-03. As of now, the project is fully functioning although there are some issues that can be fixed. We are hoping to continue to work on this project and add more features in the future, when we have time.
